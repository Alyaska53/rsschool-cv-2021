### Briefly about myself: 

In 2020 I graduated from the _Belarusian National Technical University_ with a degree in _Power Engineering_.  
Today I work as an electrical design engineer.  

Recently I realized that the chosen profession is not suitable for me. So I decided to try my hand at web development.  
I enjoy learning and solving various problems in this direction.  

I really want to become a good _front-end developer_ and I'm going to my goal!
